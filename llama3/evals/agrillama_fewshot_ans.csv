For increasing Ragi (Narrow-leafed Finger Millet) yield, I recommend:

1. Optimal spacing: 30-40 cm between rows and 15-20 cm between plants.
2. Balanced fertilization: Apply 100-120 kg of 5:10:10 NPK per acre at sowing, and 50-60 kg of 15:30:15 NPK per acre at 30-40 days after sowing.
3. Irrigation: Adequate moisture during germination and tillering, and moderate moisture during grain filling stage.
4. Pest and disease management: Regularly monitor for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and diseases like rust, leaf blight, and powdery mildew, and use integrated pest management (IPM) techniques.
5. Crop rotation and intercropping: Rotate Ragi with other crops like pulses, vegetables, or cereals to break disease and pest cycles, and intercrop with legumes to improve soil fertility.
6. Soil health: Maintain soil health by adding organic amendments, compost, or manure to improve soil structure, fertility, and water-holding capacity.
7. Variety selection: Choose high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties like 'KMF-1',"
