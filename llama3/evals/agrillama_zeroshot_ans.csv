For increasing ragi (finger millet) yield in Bangalore district of Karnataka, I recommend:

1. Optimal sowing time: Sow ragi seeds during the post-rainy season (September-October) or during the winter season (December-January).
2. Soil preparation: Ragia prefers well-draining, fertile soil with pH 6.0-7.0. Add organic manure and fertilizers as per soil test recommendations.
3. Irrigation: Ragia requires adequate moisture, especially during flowering and grain filling stages. Use drip irrigation or sprinkler irrigation to conserve water.
4. Crop rotation: Rotate ragia with other crops like maize, cotton, or vegetables to break disease and pest cycles.
5. Pest and disease management: Regularly monitor for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and diseases like downy mildew and rust. Use integrated pest management (IPM) practices to minimize chemical usage.
6. Variety selection: Choose high-yielding, disease-resistant ragi varieties like 'RMR-1', 'RMR-2', or 'RMR-3' for better yields.
7. Weed control: Maintain a weed-free crop environment by using mulching, hand-weeding, or herbicides as needed.
