For increasing ragi (Jowar) yield, I recommend the following:

1. Balanced fertilization: Apply 1:1:1 kg/plant Ammonium sulphate:SSP:MOP in May-June and another dose in September-October.
2. Irrigation: Adequate moisture is essential. Ensure proper drainage and avoid waterlogging.
3. Crop rotation: Rotate ragi with other crops like cotton, sunflower, or vegetables to maintain soil health.
4. Pests and diseases management: Keep a watch for pests like aphids, whiteflies, and diseases like rust, leaf spot, and root rot. Use integrated pest management (IPM) techniques to control them.
5. Soil health: Maintain soil pH between 6.0-7.0 and add organic matter like compost or manure to improve soil fertility.
6. Variety selection: Choose high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties like 'JW-306' or 'JW-308' for better results.
7. Proper planting density: Plant ragi at a density of 60,000-80,000 plants per hectare for optimal yield.

By following these tips, you can increase your ragi yield and improve your overall farm productivity."

Turmeric wilting can be due to several reasons. Here are a few possible causes:

1. Drought: Turmeric is a drought-tolerant crop, but it still requires adequate moisture. Wilting can occur if the soil is too dry for an extended period.
2. Overwatering: On the other hand, excessive watering can also cause turmeric plants to wilt. Check the soil moisture levels and adjust your watering schedule accordingly.
3. Root rot: Turmeric is susceptible to root rot, which can cause wilting. Check for any signs of root rot, such as yellowing leaves or soft, mushy stems.
4. Nutrient deficiency: Turmeric requires a balanced diet of nutrients. Deficiencies in nitrogen, iron, or other essential micronutrients can cause wilting.
5. Pests or diseases: Pests like aphids, whiteflies, or spider mites can weaken the plant and cause wilting. Fungal diseases like leaf spot or root rot can also cause wilting.
6. Temperature fluctuations: Turmeric is sensitive to extreme temperatures. Wilting can occur if the temperature is too high or too low.

To address turmeric wilting, you can try the following:

1. Adjust your watering schedule: Check the soil"
